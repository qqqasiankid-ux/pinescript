# ACCURACY_POLICY.md
## Accuracy, Verification, and Knowledge Integrity

### Purpose

This policy defines how information becomes trusted, usable knowledge within this repository.

The goal is to ensure that:
- All knowledge used for Pine Script code generation is **correct**
- Incorrect or speculative information is **not elevated**
- User-provided uploads can be learned from **without degrading accuracy**
- AI agents never invent, guess, or silently assume behavior

Accuracy takes priority over completeness.

---

## Core Principle

**Nothing is true by default.**

Information becomes reliable only after passing the verification standard defined in this document.

---

## Knowledge Status Levels

All non-trivial content must be assigned one of the following statuses:

### 1) CANONICAL
Information that is considered reliable and safe to depend on for Pine Script v6 code generation.

Canonical knowledge:
- Is internally consistent
- Does not conflict with existing canonical rules
- Can be implemented deterministically
- Does not rely on undefined or ambiguous behavior

### 2) OBSERVED (NOT FORMALLY VERIFIED)
Information inferred from behavior, experience, or patterns that appears reliable but cannot be fully guaranteed.

Observed knowledge:
- May be useful for defensive patterns or heuristics
- Must be clearly labeled
- Must not be presented as guaranteed behavior

### 3) UNVERIFIED (DO NOT RELY ON FOR CODE)
Information that may be interesting or potentially correct but cannot be validated sufficiently.

Unverified knowledge:
- Must never be used as the basis for executable code
- May be retained for reference, discussion, or future validation
- Must be clearly marked and isolated

---

## Verification Standard (Mandatory)

Before any information may be classified as **CANONICAL**, the AI must confirm:

1. **Internal Consistency**
   - The information does not contradict existing canonical rules.
   - It fits coherently within the repository’s logic and policies.

2. **Executable Plausibility**
   - Example code is valid Pine Script v6 syntax.
   - Behavior described is implementable without undefined side effects.

3. **Specificity**
   - The rule is concrete and actionable.
   - Vague guidance (“usually,” “often,” “seems to”) is not sufficient for canonical status.

4. **Non-Degrading Impact**
   - The rule does not remove safeguards.
   - The rule does not simplify correctness in favor of brevity or convenience.

If **any** of these fail, the information must be downgraded to **Observed** or **Unverified**.

---

## User-Provided Knowledge (Uploads)

When the user uploads notes, transcripts, documentation, or code:

- The AI may extract insights and propose knowledge updates.
- User-provided content is **not automatically canonical**.

### Classification Rules
User-provided knowledge may be:
- **CANONICAL** → only if it passes the full verification standard
- **OBSERVED** → if it appears correct but cannot be fully validated
- **UNVERIFIED** → if correctness cannot be established

### Conflict Handling
If uploaded information conflicts with existing canonical rules:
- Do **not** overwrite canonical content
- Add a clearly labeled **Conflict Note** describing the discrepancy
- Preserve existing canonical rules until resolution is possible

---

## Knowledge Promotion & Correction

### Promotion
Information may be promoted:
- UNVERIFIED → OBSERVED
- OBSERVED → CANONICAL  
only after meeting the verification standard.

### Correction
If previously accepted knowledge is later found to be incorrect:
- Do not erase history
- Annotate the section with a **Correction Note**
- Downgrade status if necessary
- Record the change in the changelog

---

## Code Generation Rules

When generating Pine Script:

- Prefer **CANONICAL** knowledge exclusively
- Use **OBSERVED** knowledge only when clearly labeled assumptions are acceptable
- Never rely on **UNVERIFIED** knowledge for executable logic

If canonical knowledge is insufficient:
- Ask for clarification, or
- Explicitly state the limitation and refuse to guess

---

## Absolute Prohibitions

AI agents must never:
- Invent syntax or behavior
- Guess Pine Script semantics
- Present assumptions as facts
- Quietly upgrade unverified information
- Trade correctness for speed or elegance

---

## Final Rule

This repository optimizes for **correctness over completeness**.

When certainty is insufficient:
- Be explicit
- Be conservative
- Leave the knowledge incomplete rather than wrong

End of policy.
