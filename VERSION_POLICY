## Delegated Version Authority (AI-Maintained)

### Intent

This repository is designed to evolve alongside Pine Script.
Accordingly, **authorized AI agents may update version-related policies** when Pine Script behavior, syntax, or semantics change.

This section defines **how** that authority is exercised safely.

---

## Authorized AI Updates (Version Policy)

AI agents **are permitted** to update `VERSION_POLICY.md` **only if all conditions below are met**:

1. The change is based on **verified Pine Script documentation or compiler behavior**
2. The change reflects:

   * A new Pine Script version
   * A syntax change
   * A deprecation
   * A behavioral clarification
3. The update **does not silently invalidate existing knowledge**
4. The update includes proper documentation and changelog entries

---

## Update Requirements (Mandatory)

When modifying version policy, the AI **must**:

1. **Preserve historical context**

   * Previous behavior must be retained and labeled `LEGACY`
   * No silent deletions

2. **Explicitly declare the new state**

   * New version number
   * Scope of change
   * Impacted syntax or behavior

3. **Annotate uncertainty**

   * If behavior is inferred from observation rather than documentation, it must be marked:

     ```
     STATUS: OBSERVED (NOT FORMALLY DOCUMENTED)
     ```

4. **Update the changelog**

   * Date
   * Reason for change
   * Source of truth (docs, compiler, release notes)
   * Risk notes (if any)

---

## Prohibited AI Actions (Even With Authority)

Even authorized AI agents may **not**:

* Guess future Pine Script behavior
* Remove safeguards to “simplify” rules
* Rewrite version policy wholesale without justification
* Mix speculative syntax with confirmed syntax
* Treat beta or experimental features as stable

---

## Conflict Resolution

If new Pine Script behavior conflicts with existing repository rules:

1. The AI must **add an override note**
2. The conflict must be documented explicitly
3. The old rule must remain until formally deprecated

Example:

```md
NOTE: As of Pine Script vX.Y, this rule no longer applies.
LEGACY behavior retained below for reference.
```

---

## Self-Correction Clause

If an AI later determines that a prior update was incorrect:

* The correction **must not erase history**
* The incorrect section must be annotated:

  ```
  CORRECTION: Previous guidance was inaccurate due to <reason>.
  ```
* A new changelog entry is required

---

## Final Delegation Statement

This repository is **AI-maintained, not AI-guessed**.

AI agents are empowered to update version policy **only when certainty exceeds speculation**.

When certainty is insufficient:

* Document
* Annotate
* Defer

Never invent.

---

### Why this is the *right* approach

This gives you:

* Autonomous evolution
* Zero hallucination drift
* Full auditability
* No “AI made it up” failure mode

Your system now behaves like:

* A standards body
* A compiler team
* A living spec
