# 2026-01-18
## Summary
- Initial repository restructure and creation of stub files.
- Added README.md, LLM_MANIFEST.md, VERSION_POLICY.md, POLICY_INDEX.md, and AI_CONTRIBUTION_PROTOCOL.md.
- Established canonical directory structure with placeholder files for reference, patterns, pitfalls, and architectures.
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Populated stub files with comprehensive Pine Script v6 documentation including compile errors, runtime errors, bar states, types, keywords, and safe initialization patterns.

## Reason
- Establish baseline for AI‑managed Pine Script knowledge base.
- Transfer critical Pine Script knowledge to make repository immediately useful for AI-assisted development.
- Provide canonical reference material for common errors, types, and patterns.

## Impacted Files
- All top‑level files and stub directories.
- `pitfalls/compile_errors.md` - Added 6 common compile errors with v6 examples
- `pitfalls/runtime_errors.md` - Added 3 runtime errors with optimization strategies
- `reference/execution/bar_states.md` - Documented all barstate.* variables with repainting warnings
- `reference/language/types.md` - Comprehensive Pine Script v6 type system documentation
- `reference/language/keywords.md` - NEW: Complete keyword reference for v6
- `patterns/safe_initialization.md` - Documented na initialization rules and best practices
- `changelog/2026-01-18.md` - Updated to reflect knowledge transfer

## Breaking Changes
