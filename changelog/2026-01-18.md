# 2026-01-18
## Summary
- Initial repository restructure and creation of stub files.
- Added README.md, LLM_MANIFEST.md, VERSION_POLICY.md, POLICY_INDEX.md, and AI_CONTRIBUTION_PROTOCOL.md.
- Established canonical directory structure with placeholder files for reference, patterns, pitfalls, and architectures.
- **Knowledge Transfer - STUB → CANONICAL:** Populated stub files with verified Pine Script v6 documentation following AI_CONTRIBUTION_PROTOCOL.md workflow.

## Nature of Updates
All files transitioned from STUB status to CANONICAL status with HIGH confidence:
- Compile errors: 6 common v6 compile-time errors with solutions
- Runtime errors: 3 common v6 runtime errors with optimization patterns
- Bar states: All 7 barstate.* variables with repainting documentation
- Type system: Complete v6 type system including na initialization rules
- Keywords: All v6 reserved keywords with control flow, logic, and module syntax
- Safe initialization: Canonical na initialization patterns per VERSION_POLICY

## Reason
- Establish baseline for AI-managed Pine Script knowledge base.
- Transfer critical Pine Script v6 knowledge to make repository immediately useful for AI-assisted development.
- Provide canonical reference material for common errors, types, and patterns.
- Enforce VERSION_POLICY.md compliance with explicit v6 syntax and //@version=6 directives.

## Source Attribution
All content derived from:
- TradingView Pine Script v6 Official Documentation (https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/)
- Pine Script v6 Language Reference and Migration Guides
- Verified behavior from Pine Script v6 compiler and execution model
- VERSION_POLICY.md na initialization requirements

## Impacted Files (STUB → CANONICAL)
- `pitfalls/compile_errors.md` - STATUS: CANONICAL, 6 compile errors with v6 examples
- `pitfalls/runtime_errors.md` - STATUS: CANONICAL, 3 runtime errors with optimization strategies
- `reference/execution/bar_states.md` - STATUS: CANONICAL, all barstate.* variables documented
- `reference/language/types.md` - STATUS: CANONICAL, comprehensive v6 type system
- `reference/language/keywords.md` - STATUS: CANONICAL (NEW FILE), complete keyword reference
- `patterns/safe_initialization.md` - STATUS: CANONICAL, na initialization rules and patterns
- `changelog/2026-01-18.md` - Updated to document knowledge transfer
- `pull_request_template.md` - DELETED (accidental file, not part of repository structure)

## Breaking Changes
- None (new repository initialization, additive content only).

## Verification Completed
Per LLM_MANIFEST requirements:
- ✓ All functions verified to exist in Pine Script v6
- ✓ No deprecated syntax used (all examples use indicator() not study())
- ✓ No array out-of-bounds access in examples
- ✓ Logic preserves accuracy with defensive patterns
- ✓ All examples include //@version=6 directive
- ✓ No hallucinated syntax (all verified against official docs)
