# POLICY_INDEX.md
## Repository Policy Directory (Authoritative)

This index lists all policy documents that AI agents must follow when reading or updating this repository.

Policies may be added over time. AI agents must:
- Consult this index to discover applicable policies
- Apply policies in addition to `LLM_MANIFEST.md`
- Never assume a policy exists unless it is listed here

### Policy List (Current)
