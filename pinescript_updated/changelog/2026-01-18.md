## Knowledge Transfer from qqqasiankid-ux/ok Repository

### Summary
Populated STUB files with verified Pine Script v6 documentation extracted from the qqqasiankid-ux/ok repository.

### Reason
Transfer canonical Pine Script v6 knowledge to the main knowledge base repository.

### Risk Level
Low - Populating empty stubs with verified, documented content.

### Files Changed

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| pitfalls/compile_errors.md | STUB to CANONICAL | Added 6 common compile errors with v6 examples |
| pitfalls/runtime_errors.md | STUB to CANONICAL | Added loop timeout, buffer limit, memory errors |
| reference/execution/bar_states.md | STUB to CANONICAL | Added all barstate variables with repainting warnings |
| reference/language/types.md | STUB to CANONICAL | Added Pine Script v6 type system documentation |
| reference/language/keywords.md | NEW FILE | Added Pine Script v6 keywords documentation |
| patterns/safe_initialization.md | STUB to CANONICAL | Added critical na initialization rules |

### Source Attribution
- Primary source: qqqasiankid-ux/ok repository

### Self-Audit Checklist
- [x] All examples use //@version=6
- [x] No hallucinated syntax
- [x] STATUS labels are appropriate
- [x] Pitfalls sections populated
- [x] Changelog updated

## Additional knowledge transfer (2026-01-18)

### Summary
Provided canonical documentation on drawing functions (mainly `plot()`) and array management.  These sections draw on the official TradingView Pine Script manual and user‑provided transcripts.  They introduce parameter descriptions, examples, and pitfalls for `plot()`, and guidelines for declaring, reading, writing and persisting arrays.

### Reason
The `pinescript` repository contained several STUB files lacking information on plotting and arrays.  The community transcripts and official docs offered verifiable knowledge to populate these stubs.

### Risk Level
Medium – Content is based on official documentation, but integration of user transcript insights is marked as canonical only where corroborated by the docs.

### Files Changed

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| reference/functions/drawing.md | STUB → CANONICAL | Added definitions and usage of `plot()` parameters (series, color, style, join, editable, show_last, display).  Included examples for EMA crossovers and background shading. |
| patterns/array_management.md | STUB → CANONICAL | Added detailed guidance on Pine arrays: declaration, type constraints, dynamic sizing, persistence (`var`/`varip`), reading/writing elements, appending, examples, and pitfalls. |

### Self‑Audit Checklist (for new changes)

- [x] Added pitfall sections for each file.
- [x] Updated changelog accordingly.
